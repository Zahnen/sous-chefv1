## Sous Chef

### Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
Sous Chef is a community-based recipe development app for non-professionals

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
1. Users can share published recipes with their own modifications/recipe notes
2. Users can contribute to other users' posted recipes with additional comments/notes
3. Users can "upvote"/+1 recipe modifications/entries

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
-ReactJS
-Firebase/NoSQL DB
-JS

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
1. Users can keep "starred" or "favorited" recipes in a personal recipe box
2. Recipes can be categorized (baking, cooking, etc) for easy navigation/recipe discovery
3. Recipes can be searched for by author or ingredient
4. Integration with Paprika API (scrapes long-form recipes and displays simple ingredients and instructions)
5. Photo uploading?

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
-Paprika API (research needed)

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

The general idea for this project is to have a hivemind/community-oriented recipe app where shared/published recipes are offered to be publicly modified by other users, and those modifications are "accepted" or voted on by other users. Usually, you see modification suggestions in the comments of online recipes, and this would be a tool for users to take "base" recipes and improve them together.
